# C++ Plugin Framework

The purpose of this plugin framework is to simplify creation and loading of C++ plugins.

The framework can be used to create cross-platform plugins, since it is using only Qt and STL libraries.

It is recommended to build the C++ plugin framework, the plugins and the application with the same development environment to avoid the problem of ABI incompatibility between compilers and used libraries.
